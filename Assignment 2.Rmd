## Question 3. In this question, we will use R to plot a time series, create an MA series and plot the MA series.

```{r}
library(TTR)

# read data
d <- read.csv('https://bryantstats.github.io/math475/data/MedCPISmooth.csv')

# frequency = 4 for quarterly data, 
# frequency = 12 for monthly data, 
# frequency = 1 for yearly data, by default frequency = 1

t1 = ts(d$PerMEDCPI, start = 1947, frequency = 4)

# plot the time series
plot(t1, main = paste0("Medical Component of the CPI"))

# In exponential smoothing, a higher ratio will weight more on the recent observation, 
# ratio close to 1 will have a 100% weight on the most recent observation
w = .1

t1_ema = EMA(t1, ratio = 1-w)

plot(t1,  main = paste0("Exponential Smoothing with w = ", w))
lines(t1_ema, col = "red")
```

Increasing w from w=0.1 to w=0.5

```{r}
library(TTR)

# read data
d <- read.csv('https://bryantstats.github.io/math475/data/MedCPISmooth.csv')

# frequency = 4 for quarterly data, 
# frequency = 12 for monthly data, 
# frequency = 1 for yearly data, by default frequency = 1

t1 = ts(d$PerMEDCPI, start = 1947, frequency = 4)

# plot the time series
plot(t1, main = paste0("Medical Component of the CPI"))

# In exponential smoothing, a higher ratio will weight more on the recent observation, 
# ratio close to 1 will have a 100% weight on the most recent observation
w = .5

t1_ema = EMA(t1, ratio = 1-w)

plot(t1,  main = paste0("Exponential Smoothing with w = ", w))
lines(t1_ema, col = "red")
```


## Question 4. In this assignment we will study the dataset about the economy of Algeria.

- Plot the time series of Algeriaâ€™s Exports
- Plot an exponential smoothing series for the above time series. What is your choice for w?

```{r}
library(TTR)

# read data
d <- read.csv('https://bryantstats.github.io/math475/assignments/data/algeria_economy.csv')

# frequency = 4 for quarterly data, 
# frequency = 12 for monthly data, 
# frequency = 1 for yearly data, by default frequency = 1

t1 = ts(d$Exports, start = 1960, frequency = 4)

# plot the time series
plot(t1, main = paste0("Algeria's Exports"))


# In exponential smoothing, a higher ratio will weight more on the recent observation, 
# ratio close to 1 will have a 100% weight on the most recent observation
w = .8

t1_ema = EMA(t1, ratio = 1-w)

plot(t1,  main = paste0("Exponential Smoothing with w = ", w))
lines(t1_ema, col = "red")
```
# My choice for w is w=0.8
